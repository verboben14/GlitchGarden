# GlitchGarden
A 2D wave management game inspired by Plants vs Zombies.

This game was a project developed while learning with a GameDev.tv course.
The core of the game is pretty much the same as Plants vs Zombies, I am just using different assets and animations.
There is only 1 level for now but I am planning on continuing the development.
